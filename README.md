<div/>

I am a cybersecurity enthusiast with an affinity for threat hunting and analysis. My journey in computer science led me to develop a passion for 
cybersecurity. I started my career as a computer repair technician back in the 1990s while enrolled in a high school vocational program for 
computer programming. Since that time, I have worked in roles across multiple IT and cybersecurity disciplines including network and system 
administration, vulnerability assessment, identity access management, and information security compliance assurance. I also have practical 
knowledge and experience in threat intelligence analysis, operational and project management, quality assurance, and leadership from my 24 
years of military experience.

## Objective

My immediate objective is to obtain a role that leverages my skillset to make an actionable positive impact on an organization's security 
posture and reduce the organization's overall attack surface and risk profile. An ideal role would  provide specialization in cybersecurity 
governance, risk management, and compliance assurance, while also providing opportunity to develop and challenge my technical skills.
